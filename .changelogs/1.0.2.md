## Release 1.0.2
Nothing big this time, just a small update to address a bug with Tinker's Construct that managed to slip by.

Requires [UniMixins](https://github.com/LegacyModdingMC/UniMixins/releases) and [Forgelin](https://github.com/GTNewHorizons/Forgelin/releases)

## Added Support
* Tinker's Construct: Extra leaves on Ore and Essence Berry Bushes will render smaller, according to the growth stage of the plant. Just like the bushes from Natura.
