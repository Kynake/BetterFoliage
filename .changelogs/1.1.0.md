## Release 1.1.0
Added the option `Surface only` (enabled by default), under the `Extra Leaves` menu to the config file. This makes so that extra leaves are only rendered on blocks that have at least one visible side, which should decrease the appearance of completely shadowed leaves.
It doesn't completely remove them, but the more obvious cases where it happens in naturally generated leaf blocks should be fixed.

**Important:** If you are updating from the original BetterFoliage mod or a previous version of this one you must delete the config file located at `config/BetterFoliage.cfg` and let the mod regenerate it on the next game launch for the fix to be applied. Make a backup of any settings you've changed before doing so.

Requires [UniMixins](https://github.com/LegacyModdingMC/UniMixins/releases) and [Forgelin](https://github.com/GTNewHorizons/Forgelin/releases)
