**Important:** If you are updating from the original BetterFoliage mod or a previous version of this one you must delete the config file located at `config/BetterFoliage.cfg` and let the mod regenerate it on the next game launch for the fix to be applied. Make a backup of any settings you've changed before doing so.

Requires [UniMixins](https://github.com/LegacyModdingMC/UniMixins/releases) and either [Forgelin: Legacy](https://github.com/LegacyModdingMC/Forgelin) or [GTNH's Forgelin](https://github.com/GTNewHorizons/Forgelin/releases). <br>
(Use whichever one comes included in your modpack. If neither is present, I recommend Forgelin: Legacy over GTNH's Forgelin)

## Changes
Thanks to @FalsePattern for migrating BF to LegacyModdingMC Forgelin.
It will continue to work with GTNH's Forgelin, so you don't need any extra mods (except this one, of course) to use in GTNH.

Biomes O' Plenty petal blocks will now not render Extra Leaves and Falling Leaves by default.
This behaviour can be reverted in the configs for those that prefer it.

## Fixes
Lilypad rendering has been improved. Lilypads now have 0 thickness (like they do in vanilla MC) and the root and flower have been properly aligned to the main body.
This also fixes a rendering bug when using [Beddium](https://github.com/vfx-dev/Beddium).

Fixed bug where the side textures of cactus blocks were mirrored on the north and west axis.
Fixed bug where black seams would appear in between cactus blocks when using Angelica.

Fixed a bug with [Angelica](https://github.com/GTNewHorizons/Angelica) and [NotFine](https://github.com/jss2a98aj/NotFine) where sides of leaf blocks would become invisible when next to a rounded log block.
