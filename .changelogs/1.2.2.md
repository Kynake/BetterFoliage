**Important:** If you are updating from the original BetterFoliage mod or a previous version of this one you must delete the config file located at `config/BetterFoliage.cfg` and let the mod regenerate it on the next game launch for fixes to be applied. Make a backup of any settings you've changed before doing so.

Requires [UniMixins](https://github.com/LegacyModdingMC/UniMixins/releases) and either [Forgelin: Legacy](https://github.com/LegacyModdingMC/Forgelin) or [GTNH's Forgelin](https://github.com/GTNewHorizons/Forgelin/releases). <br>
(Use whichever one comes included in your modpack. If neither is present, I recommend Forgelin: Legacy over GTNH's Forgelin)
