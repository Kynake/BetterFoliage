**Important:** If you are updating from the original BetterFoliage mod or a previous version of this one _(1.2.1 or earlier)_ you must delete the config file located at `config/BetterFoliage.cfg` and let the mod regenerate it on the next game launch for fixes to be applied. Make a backup of any settings you've changed before doing so.

Requires [UniMixins](https://github.com/LegacyModdingMC/UniMixins/releases) and either [Forgelin: Legacy](https://github.com/LegacyModdingMC/Forgelin) or [GTNH's Forgelin](https://github.com/GTNewHorizons/Forgelin/releases). <br>
(Use whichever one comes included in your modpack. If neither is present, I recommend Forgelin: Legacy over GTNH's Forgelin)

Only bugfixes this time, so no need to update your config file if you were previously using version 1.2.2.

## Fixes
- Fix render bug when placing an upside-down stair or slab on top of a connected grass block.
- Fix Better Foliage not rendering anything when in a subchunk that only contained BF blocks.
- Fix crash when playing with GregTech 5 Unofficial and pollution was set to false.
- Fix render bug between many non-cube blocks placed next to rounded logs when using Angelica or NotFine.
