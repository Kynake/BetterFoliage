**Important:** If you are updating from the original BetterFoliage mod or a previous version of this one (1.2.2 or earlier) you must delete the config file located at `config/BetterFoliage.cfg` and let the mod regenerate it on the next game launch for fixes to be applied. Make a backup of any settings you've changed before doing so.

Requires [UniMixins](https://github.com/LegacyModdingMC/UniMixins/releases) and either [Forgelin: Legacy](https://github.com/LegacyModdingMC/Forgelin) or [GTNH's Forgelin](https://github.com/GTNewHorizons/Forgelin/releases). <br>
(Use whichever one comes included in your modpack. If neither is present, I recommend Forgelin: Legacy over GTNH's Forgelin)

The previous release had a regression bug with Biomes O' Plenty leaves that I missed. Thanks @Omgise for pointing it out! <br>
Since this is a bugfix release, if you're updating from 1.2.3 you don't need to delete the config file.

## Fixes
- Fix regression where custom render types would ignore the `captureShadingOnly` variable
