### FAQ

I've upgraded from an older version or from the original mod to this, and I don't see some of the new features or fixes

- Delete the config file located at `config/BetterFoliage.cfg` and let the mod regenerate it on the next game launch. Make a backup of any settings you've changed before doing so.
